05 Generate You What You Want
=============================

⚔️  Challenge Round One! 🎉

Try generating (and running) a language that isn't JavaScript. :)

There's index.js, as it was from the last solution. I've added
`haskell.js` as my own Haskell-generating attempt at this. There
is no fixed solution; have at it. :D

(Suggestioned languages: Ruby, TypeScript, Lua.)
